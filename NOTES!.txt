BLOCKS 4 README
By Owen Rudge

This is the horrible mess that is Blocks 4.

I have not included the music. You should put all the Blocks+ music
files in the Music directory. I have also not included FONTS.DAT or
SFX.DAT, as these are identical to the Blocks 3 equivalent. You may
want to change the title bitmap - it was something I knocked up a
while ago and doesn't work perfectly.

In the GRAPHICS directory are a number of .BGP and .BMP files. The
BMP files are, surprise surprise, bitmap files, but the .BGP files
are special description files (Blocks Graphics Pack is the proper
name). The format is as follows:

[Blocks]
Version=4
Title=Castle
Special=2
UID=CSTL
Filename=./graphics/CASTLE.BMP
Music=./music/inside.s3m

Version is the version number the graphics pack is meant to work with.
I'm not entirely sure if I actually wrote code to check this! Title is
the "friendly" name for this. Special is the ID number of the equivalent
"old-style" motif, if applicable. UID is the 4-letter ID string for it.
Filename is the filename to the bitmap file - YOU MUST INCLUDE THE
./graphics/ BIT! Music is the path to the music file, if applicable. I
did originally try to get this all into a .DAT file, but failed (not
because of the DAT code, but because the rest of my code was horribly
hackish and buggy. It still is... ;-)).

I reimplemented the Blocks+ style of having different music for every
motif. You can turn this off by modifying BLOCKS4.CFG.

The MAP file format has changed slightly. Instead of a number for the
motif, you have the 4-letter ID string. The CONVERT.C file will
convert old-style MAP files to the new format. Blocks 4 can also do
this "on-the-fly", but everything seems to be a square or two off. I
don't know why. Something's gone wrong obviously...

I think that's all for now. There's bound to be something I've
forgotton..... If you have any trouble, e-mail me at
blocks4@orudge.freeuk.com.

Have fun! :-)
