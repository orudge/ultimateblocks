- home directory stuff (see DetermineBasePaths in OpenTTD)
- lasers don't draw when on higher than 0 z-level (eg, one level in blocks3 map near the end)

keyboard stuff:

- implement F2, backspace, etc

from Blocks3.doc:

- Ending and Intro sequence
- Arrange levels for editor
- More monsters
- More levels
- More motifs
- Death sequence (eg, falling off, as in Blocks+)
- Moving lasers

other stuff:

- replays
- show statistics - how many levels completed in map set, current level at, time taken, etc

levels:

- blocks1:
  - level 25 - monsters meant to move in same direction
  - level 34 - the blocks below it get touched, they shouldn't.

bug:

monsters, etc, start moving even when "get ready" is displayed?
